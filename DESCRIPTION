Description: Provides a C++ implementation of a quadtree data structure. Functions are
  provided for creating a quadtree from a raster, with the level of 'coarseness' of the
  quadtree being determined by a user-supplied parameter. In addition, functions are 
  provided to extract values of the quadtree at point locations. Functions for calculating 
  least-cost paths between two points are also provided.
